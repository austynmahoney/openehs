For the printer to work, you must have the printer installed on your computer and also have the Dymo Label Software (DLS) installed.

Follow these steps:
1. Do not plug in the printer in yet.
2. Install the DLS software; you should be prompted to plug in the printer during the installation.
3. Install the LabelWriterDrivers-64x driver, if you are using a 64bit operating system.
